This project is a mobile application that tells the user how much it will suck to have to go outside to smoke based on weather. It makes use of google's geolocation API for getting the user's coordinates, GEO IP Database API for converting the coordinates to city name, and Dark Sky Weather API for pulling weather data for the user's location. It uses a 30 point system for determining the subjective shittiness of the smoking experience based on a 30 point system. These 30 points are based on three subcategories: temperature (TMP), precipitation type and amount (WTHR), and wind speed (WIND). Point totals for each subcategory are determined based on the current weather's closeness to an empirically determined "sweet spot" range. The app works best on chrome, but is responsive across different device sizes.
